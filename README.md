# MonsterChase
Delay the Inevitable : monsters are chasing you ! Try to survive as long as possible (use your timer and beat your own score or with friends) ~

Update : for this game jam, my team decided to stop 9 hours before the end so I made this short project in the remaining hours I had left, which isn't so bad ! It was fun and quite challenging, so the bugs are plenty. But I learned a lot and although I couldn't fix the UI and add a timer at the end, I'm proud of my first game jam.
